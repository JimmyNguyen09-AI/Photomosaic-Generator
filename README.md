# [PYTHON] Photomosaic generator

## Introduction

A Photo Mosaic Project is a creative application where a large image is recreated using many smaller images (tiles) arranged in a way that they collectively resemble the original picture. This project involves processing images, segmenting them into grids, and replacing each grid with the most visually matching smaller image from a dataset.


## Data preparation
I have taken data from online sources to make data for this project. You can see the image dataset in **messi** folder
## Video to video
By running the sript **video2video.py**, we will have following output:
<p align="center">
  <img src="demo/output1.gif" width=600><br/>
  <i>Demo output video</i>
</p>


## Image to image
By running the sript **image2image.py**, we will have following output:
<p align="center">
  <img src="demo/output.jpg" width=600><br/>
  <i>Output image</i>
</p>


<p align="center">
  <img src="demo/input.jpg" width=600><br/>
  <i>Input image</i>
</p>
